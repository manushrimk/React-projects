            <p align="justify">Former Team India captain Virat Kohli could not stop laughing after finally smacking his <span style="color: blue;">71st international century</span>  on Thursday against Afghanistan. He had to wait <span style="color: blueviolet;">989 days</span> to be precise to reach the elusive three-figure mark, with his last hundred coming in November 2019.

                The 33-year-old, who has often been under severe criticism for his recent form, smacked his 71st international century to move to second in the list of the all-time top international centurions alongside legendary Australian batter Ricky Ponting. Meanwhile, Sachin Tendulkar still leads the way with 100 international tons.</p>
            <h2><b>Kohli explains celebrations after <b>71st international ton:</b></h2>
            <p align="justify">While speaking in his post-innings interview, Virat Kohli said, "It was indeed (the celebrations was worth 1000 words). Very blessed, and very grateful right now. The last two and half years have taught me a lot. I am going to turn 34 in November, so the celebrations are for the past. I have put a lot of things into perspective. I was a bit shocked as this was the format I least expected for a century to come anytime soon. It is all God's blessing." </p>
